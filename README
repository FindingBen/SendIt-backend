BUG LOG SECTION

1. Archived function bug
   This occoured or it was spotted on 3rd of November 2024. The Archive function executed multiple times, but it was suppose to be executed only once.
   As a result of that, over a 50 campaign_stat objects were created because the way it works is eveyrtime archive func is ran, it creates new campaign_stat
   object. Its assuming that campaign is finished and it collects all the information about it and stores the info in campaign_stat object. It seems that celery can
   execute it multiple times when it restores the Tasks that were initially created.
